# Car-Price-Prediction
An Machine Learning for Car price prediction.
In this project we can predict the price of car using the features of car such as engine size, horse power, name of the car, type of fuel etc....
using linear regression model.

Problem Statement:
                   The prices of new cars in the industry is fixed by the manufacturer with some additional costs incurred by the Government in the form of taxes. So, customers buying a new car can be assured of the money they invest to be worthy. But due to the increased price of new cars and the incapability of customers to buy new cars due to the lack of funds, used cars sales are on a global increase (Pal, Arora and Palakurthy, 2018). There is a need for a used car price prediction system to effectively determine the worthiness of the car using a variety of features. Even though there are websites that offers this service, their prediction method may not be the best. Besides, different models and systems may contribute on predicting power for a used carâ€™s actual market value. It is important to know their actual market value while both buying and selling.
                   
Project description:
                    One of the main areas of research in machine learning is the prediction of the price of cars. It is based on finance and the marketing domain. 
It is a major research topic in machine learning because the price of a car depends on many factors. Some of the factors that contribute a lot to the price of a car are:
                          Brand, Model, Horsepower, Mileage, Safety Features, GPS and many more.
If one ignores the brand of the car, a car manufacturer primarily fixes the price of a car based on the features it can offer a customer. Later, the brand may raise the price depending on its goodwill, but the most important factors are what features a car gives you to add value to your life. So, in the section below, I will walk you through the task of training a car price prediction model with machine learning using the Python programming language.
